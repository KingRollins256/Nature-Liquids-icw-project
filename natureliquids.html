							<p1>Juicing is a way to consume fruits or vegetables in liquid form. You need a juicer, an appliance, to separate the pulp (fiber) of the fruit or vegetable from the liquid. The liquid is thin and easy to drink, and it has the vitamins and minerals from the fruits and vegetables. Juicing often involves using a machine to take out the juice from fresh fruits or vegetables. The liquid contains most of the vitamins, minerals and plant chemicals found in the fruit. But whole fruits and vegetables also have healthy fiber, which is lost during most juicing. </p1>
